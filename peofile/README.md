# OpenC4S — Open Code for Society

**OpenC4S** is a community-driven initiative focused on building **Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)** that empower individuals and communities in their daily lives. We believe technology should serve people — not the other way around.

## 🌍 Mission

To create accessible, privacy-respecting, sustainable, and open software and systems that address real-world societal needs — from education to health, governance, communication, sustainability, and more.

## 🚀 What We Do

- 🛠️ Develop and maintain open source tools that solve everyday problems.
- 📚 Educate people about the benefits of FOSS and digital autonomy.
- 🤝 Collaborate with local communities, nonprofits, schools, and governments.
- 🧪 Incubate new ideas that promote open, ethical, and inclusive tech.

## 💡 Why FOSS?

- ✅ **Freedom**: Use, study, modify, and distribute without restrictions.
- 🔒 **Privacy-first**: We don’t track. We don’t profit from your data.
- 🌱 **Sustainability**: Built for long-term use by real communities.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Inclusive by Design**: We build **with** people, not just *for* them.
